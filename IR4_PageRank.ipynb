    "The code implements the PageRank algorithm, which is used to rank pages in a graph (such as web pages) based on their importance. Here's a short explanation of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Explanation:\n",
    "pagerank(): This function computes the PageRank scores for each page in a graph represented by an adjacency matrix.\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "adj_matrix: The adjacency matrix represents the links between pages. If adj_matrix[i][j] is non-zero, it indicates a link from page j to page i.\n",
    "damping_factor: This is the probability that a user will follow a link (usually set to 0.85). The remaining probability (0.15) represents \"teleporting,\" where the user jumps to a random page.\n",
    "max_iters: The maximum number of iterations to run the PageRank calculation.\n",
    "tol: Tolerance for convergence. If the change in the PageRank values between iterations is smaller than this, the algorithm stops early.\n",
    "Steps in the Function:\n",
    "Create Stochastic Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalize the adjacency matrix column-wise (divide each column by its sum) to ensure the sum of each column equals 1. This transforms the matrix into a stochastic matrix where each column represents a probability distribution.\n",
    "Initialize PageRank:\n",
    "\n",
    "Set the initial PageRank values (page_rank) to be equal for all pages (i.e., 1/n for n pages).\n",
    "Iterative Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "In each iteration, update the page_rank vector using the formula:\n",

    " )+damping_factor√óstochastic_matrix√ópage_rank\n",
    "This combines the teleportation factor and the link-following factor.\n",
    "Convergence Check:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the change in the page_rank values between iterations is smaller than the specified tolerance (tol), the algorithm stops early.\n",
    "Return PageRank:\n",
    "\n",
    "After the iterations, the final page_rank vector is returned, which represents the importance of each page.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "An example adjacency matrix is given for a graph with 4 pages.\n",
    "The matrix indicates which pages link to others (e.g., Page 1 links to Pages 2 and 3, and so on).\n",
    "The function calculates the PageRank scores for these pages and prints the result.\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "The PageRank values are printed for each of the 4 pages, indicating their relative importance based on the link structure in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "Damping Factor: Represents the probability of following links versus teleporting.\n",
    "Stochastic Matrix: Each column in the adjacency matrix is normalized to sum to 1, ensuring it represents probabilities.\n",
    "Convergence: The algorithm stops when the PageRank values stabilize, indicating that further iterations won‚Äôt change the results significantly.\n",
