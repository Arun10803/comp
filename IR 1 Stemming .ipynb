    "'''\n",
    "The code you've provided is a basic implementation of text preprocessing that involves several key steps, such as tokenization, removing stopwords, stemming, and punctuation removal. Let's go through each part of the code and explain the technical terms and the overall procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Libraries and Imports\n",
    "NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): This is a comprehensive Python library for natural language processing (NLP). It provides tools to tokenize text, remove stopwords, stem words, and perform other text processing tasks.\n",
    "word_tokenize: A function that splits a string of text into individual words.\n",
    "stopwords: A corpus of common stopwords (such as \"the\", \"and\", \"is\") in many languages, including English.\n",
    "PorterStemmer: A stemmer from the NLTK library that reduces words to their root form.\n",
    "2. Sample Text (random_text)\n",
    "This is a string containing 100 words, simulating raw, unprocessed text. The text contains multiple sentences related to data processing, cleaning, and transformation. Your goal is to preprocess this text by removing irrelevant parts (like stopwords) and normalizing it (through stemming, lowercasing, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Tokenization (word_tokenize)\n",
    "Tokenization is the process of splitting a text into smaller parts (tokens), usually words or sentences. Itâ€™s the first step in most NLP tasks because it turns raw text into manageable units.\n",
    "The word_tokenize(random_text) function breaks down the random_text string into individual words. The result is a list of words and punctuation marks, like this:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "['Data', 'processing', 'encompasses', 'a', 'series', 'of', 'operations', ...]\n",
    "4. Stopword Removal\n",
    "Stopwords are common words that don't carry significant meaning and are often removed in text preprocessing. Examples include words like \"the\", \"and\", \"is\", etc. They appear frequently in most texts and do not help much in the analysis.\n",
    "Why remove stopwords?: Removing stopwords helps reduce the size of the dataset, focusing on the more meaningful words for analysis.\n",
    "The NLTK stopwords.words(\"english\") function returns a list of common English stopwords, which you store in stop_words. In the preprocessing loop, you check whether each word in the random_text is a stopword. If it's not, the word is kept; otherwise, it is ignored.\n",
    "5. Punctuation Removal\n",
    "Punctuation Removal: You use the word.strip('.,?!-()[]{}\"') line to remove punctuation marks from words.\n",
    "Why is this needed?: Punctuation marks are generally not useful in text analysis, especially when you want to focus on the meaning of words themselves. For instance, words like \"data.\" and \"data\" should be treated as the same word.\n",
    "This strip method removes common punctuation marks from both ends of a word.\n",
    "For example, the word \"data.\" becomes \"data\", which is easier to process.\n",
    "6. Stemming\n",
    "Stemming is a process that reduces a word to its root or base form. For instance, the stemmer would reduce the word \"processing\" to \"process\", and \"running\" to \"run\".\n",
    "Why stem words?: This reduces variations of a word to a common root, which is useful for text analysis, as it treats different forms of a word as a single unit (e.g., \"run\", \"runs\", \"running\" are all reduced to \"run\").\n",
    "The PorterStemmer().stem(word) method from NLTK is applied to each word after it has been stripped of punctuation and checked against stopwords.\n",
    "7. Preprocessed Words\n",
    "In the loop:\n",
    "Each word is checked to ensure it is not a stopword.\n",
    "The word is then stemmed.\n",
    "The processed word is added to the list preprocessed_words.\n",
    "After processing all words, preprocessed_words will contain a cleaned version of the original text, with stopwords removed and words reduced to their stemmed form.\n",
    "8. Joining Processed Words Back into Text\n",
    "After all the words have been processed, they are joined back into a string using \" \".join(preprocessed_words). This creates a single string, preprocessed_text, where the words are separated by spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original (after tokenization and punctuation removal): ['data', 'process', 'encompass', 'seri', 'oper', 'convert', 'raw', ...]\n",
    "Preprocessed Text: 'data process encompass seri oper convert raw data structur organ inform process ...'\n",
    "9. Output\n",
    "The original text and the preprocessed text are printed for comparison. The preprocessed text will show a cleaner, more uniform version of the text, ready for further analysis like machine learning, text classification, or information retrieval.\n",
    "Summary of the Steps:\n",
    "Tokenize the input text into individual words.\n",
    "Remove stopwords (e.g., \"the\", \"is\", \"a\").\n",
    "Remove punctuation from each word.\n",
    "Stem each word to reduce it to its base form (e.g., \"running\" â†’ \"run\").\n",
    "Reassemble the processed words into a clean text.\n",
    "Why is this important?\n",
    "This preprocessing pipeline is essential for transforming raw text into a format that can be efficiently analyzed. Without these steps, the text would contain unnecessary noise (like stopwords and punctuation) and word variations (like \"running\" and \"runs\") that could hinder the analysis or machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "By preprocessing the text, you ensure that the analysis focuses on the meaningful, relevant parts of the text, making it easier to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract insights,\n",
    "Perform sentiment analysis,\n",
    "Build search engines, or\n",
    "Train machine learning models like classifiers or topic models.\n",
